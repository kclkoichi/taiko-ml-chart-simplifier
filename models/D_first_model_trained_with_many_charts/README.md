SUPER SLOW! Took 37h total (!? not sure if counted sleep time... not so long though, like 2h max)

output_dim=64
128 LSTM units
epochs=500, batch_size=32

Trained with official game music songs only
With only the songs which had the same number of lines 
about 17500 lines for each difficulty

So not megalovania. not zelda probably(?)
Wait. 
TODO: actually let's really check which songs were used
