Quite really fast. Without early stopping, took about 2h per model.

output_dim=64
128 LSTM units
epochs=300, batch_size=32

Trained with E_dataset. About 8500 lines of only 4 beats songs.

Comparision with model D predictions on a paper irl that I wrote on.
Tbh both have their advantages and it's crazy that model E 
is also useful considering the small amount of time it used to be trained.
