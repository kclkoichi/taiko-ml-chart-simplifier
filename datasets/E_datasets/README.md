Only 4 beats charts. Restrictions on #SCROLL #BPMCHANGE count (apart from a few exceptions)
Can look at to_make_model_E to get more info

Unfortunately, many many charts have different line count among difficulties, Oni/Edit being the odd one out very very often
Only got 8531 lines for each difficulty (only 88 charts!)

If this model doesn't work well, might make:
- Hard -> Normal model
- Normal -> Easy model
together because they are easier to make

And make
- Edit/Oni -> Hard model
separately because making this model is significantly harder
(in terms of prediction and also in terms of preparing the dataset)
